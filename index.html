    A horse is a strong and graceful animal known for its speed, beauty, and loyalty. It has been a trusted companion to humans for thousands of years, helping in travel, farming, sports, and even therapy. Horses come in many breeds, colors, and sizes, each with unique qualities. They are herbivores and usually eat grass, hay, and grains. With their powerful legs and keen sense of awareness, horses are often seen in races, shows, and riding trails. Their gentle nature and ability to bond with people make them special animals admired all over the world.
